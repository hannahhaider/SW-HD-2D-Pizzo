# SW-HD-2D-Pizzo
This repository contains all the code used to run the 2D pizzo model of the hydrodynamic solar wind. In particular, 3 numerical schemes are included to approximate the model and compare accuracy/stability. The Euler upwind scheme, MacCormack predictor/corrector scheme, as well as a MacCormack scheme in conjunction with an artificial viscous term added to the governing equations.
