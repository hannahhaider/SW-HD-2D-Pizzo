# SW-HD-2D-Pizzo
This repository contains all the code used to run the 2D model of the hydrodynamic solar wind as presented in Pizzo (1979). In particular, 3 numerical schemes are included to approximate the model and compare accuracy/stability. The Euler upwind scheme, MacCormack predictor/corrector scheme, as well as a MacCormack scheme + an artificial viscous term added to the governing equations.
